# openweathermap-airflow-etl-pipeline
In this project, I have build an ETL(Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline using openwethermap API and Airflow(Orchestration tool) on AWS. The pipeline will retrieve weather data of city from openwethermap API, transform it to desire format and load it into an AWS data storage.
